这个.next() 会自动加1，但是不能加两次

貌似是利用迭代器直接导出下一个可用的主机号



我发现原始的ebgp案例，r1 的loopback接口和 r2的直连接口都同时拥有10.0.0.1这个地址，先在gns3上测试一下，看看是什么效果

测试中，仅仅在第一步部署ip就发现

[routing - Why do I get "% Warning: use /31 mask on non point-to-point interface cautiously" when I use a /31 subnet mask? - Network Engineering Stack Exchange](https://networkengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/25991/why-do-i-get-warning-use-31-mask-on-non-point-to-point-interface-cautiously)

Your problem is that you are addressing in two separate networks: `216.21.5.0/31` and `216.21.5.2/31`. The addresses you are using are in the same `/30` network, but two separate `/31` networks.

You need to set one address as `216.21.5.0` and the other address as `216.21.5.1`, or set one address as `216.21.5.2` and the other address as `216.21.5.3`.

The warning is because ethernet is a broadcast technology which can have multiple endpoints, but a `/31` network can only use two endpoints. If you were configuring it on a true point-to-point medium, I don't think you would get the warning.



得知原有的分配方式肯定是有问题的。，全0和全1是用不成的啊
